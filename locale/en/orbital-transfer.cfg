[mod-setting-description]
orbital-transfer-debug=Enable debug messages on events except for request fulfillment.
orbital-transfer-deep-debug=Enable debug messages on all events, very spammy. Recommend also setting tick rate to 600.
orbital-transfer-tick-rate=Checks to fulfill requests every N ticks. Higher values may increase performance if you have a lot of platforms, but also increase lag time.
orbital-transfer-delivery-delay=Point-to-point delivery time in ticks between provider and requester. Higher or lower values may make the animation look funny.
orbital-transfer-fuel-oxidizer-barrels=Enables barelling for thruster fuel and oxidizer
